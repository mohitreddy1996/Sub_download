# Subtitle downloader
Python script to search for the subtitle for a movie in the subDB database.

Copy the source file into the movie directory.

Run the code with movie name as the command line argument and Subtitle gets automatically downloaded with the same name as movie name on your computer.

Edit : Now the Movie runs after the subtitle is downloaded.
